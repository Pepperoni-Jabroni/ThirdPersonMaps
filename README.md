Render those pesky Minecraft Maps in everyone's favorite perspective: third person. #thirdpersongang

This is a **client-side mod**. All you have to do is simply hold a Map & be in third person! The Map HUD works exactly as you'd expect:
- Updates in real time
- Works with non-fully explored Maps
- Works at any scale
- Works with both left & right hands

You can force the Map scale in the HUD if you don't like the default size. Please see the file in your config folder.
